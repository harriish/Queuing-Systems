# Queuing-Systems
M/M/1 queuing systems

Goal of the project: To find average number of customers in queuing net (N= N1 + N2 +N3) i.e; who get gambling services from all casino tables.

Experimental design :

There are three M/M/1 queues and these three servers S1 , S2 and S3 work with service rates μ1 =10 customers /min, μ2 =81 customers/min, respective μ3 =210 programs /min. New customers arrive at servers S1 and S2 according to Poisson processes of rate λA = 28, and λB =14 customers per minute. In each M/M/1 system we assume the departure rate is same of arrival rate .

In our project we consider 3 M/M/1 servers , where services define activities done on its respective Casino table.
